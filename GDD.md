### Core Concept

<table style="border: none;">
    <tr style="border: none;">
        <td style="border: none;">
            Tasked with protecting a sacred light from the encroaching darkness, they must navigate the night and evade the darkness's minions. Chased by the "darkness" and its zealous supporters, the acolyte's mission is to ensure the flame remains lit, representing hope for another day. With just 5 minutes until dawn, every second counts, for if the flame is extinguished, fear will spread unchecked throughout the land.

### Player Movement

- 8-directional movement system (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- Walking backwards incurs speed penalty

### Enemies and Combat

- Enemies are **invisible**, ghost-like creatures with a melee attack
<p align="center">
    <img src="Images/enemy_reference_1.png" width="400">
    <br>Source: Nosferatu (1922)
</p>

- They can be spotted by **observing their shadows**, cast by the player's lantern or environmental light sources
<p align="center">
    <img src="Images/shadow_mockup.png" width="400">
</p>

- Enemies briefly become visible when they:
  - Hit the player (Detection of hits via raycast function)
  - Take damage

- Lantern brightness also determines the likeliness of attracting enemies. Dimmer light means less likely to attract enemies and vice versa.

Inspiration for games where light is important for gameplay include Cryospace and Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

  Gameplay still from Cryospace showing limited visibility and a player controlled light source
</p>

### Camera/View

- Fixed rotation 3rd person isometric with approx. 45¬∞ viewing angle
- Player is locked to centre of screen (camera moves with player movement)
- When the player reaches the edge of the game world, they will be slightly off centre; this allows the player to see more of the game world while near its edge.
  - This is demonstrated in the diagram below. Note how in FOV 2 the player is off-centre.

<p align="center">
    <img src="Images/camera_movement.png" width="400">
</p>
   
- We have decided to use a moving camera as it can make the gameplay feel more dynamic - well suited to the action/horror genre

Underrail (2015) is a good example of the intended viewing angle:

<p align="center">
<img src="Images/underrail_screenshot.jpg" width="300">
</p>
And Synthetik (2018) uses a camera locked to the players movements:

</p>

### Controls

    <img src="Images/Keyboard_edit_crop.png" width="500">
    <img src="Images/Mouse_edit_1.png" width="287">
    <br>Note: Player walking speed will be slower when walking <i>backwards</i> (e.g. facing north and walking south).
</p>

* Left Shift to *dash*, briefly increasing movement speed.

### Progression

As a roguelite-inspired game, Lantern Head features permadeath and items that do not persist between playthroughs.

Within a single playthrough, difficulty will increase due to

- Increased enemy spawn rates
- Presence of enemies with higher stats
- Attrition of resources if the player overuses their potions/lantern oil

<table style="border: none;">
    <tr style="border: none;">
        <td style="border: none;">
   The player's power level will also increase over the course of the game by finding <it>potions</it>, which have effects including:
            <ul>
                <li>Increasing player speed</li>
                <li>Increasing lantern brightness</li>
                <li>Increasing lantern illumination angle</li>
                <li>Increasing max health and max lantern oil</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td style="border: none;">
            <img src="Images/potion_asset.png" width="500" />

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

To encourage replayability, the game will feature a **scoring system** based on:

- The number of enemies killed
- The number of _braziers_ that are lit by the player

There will also be **achievements** awarded to players for unusual or impressive feats, such as:

- Completing the game without killing an enemy
- Completing the game without lighting a single candle
- Completing the game without using the lantern attack
- Dying within the first minute, etc.

## World Design

Lantern Head takes place within the confines of an abandoned religious compound, in the style of an old-world monastery or cathedral.

This temple shows signs of advanced decay, as plant growth gradually reclaims the crumbling masonry, giving the player the sense that they are the last defender of this place against the unknown and wild forces outside its walls.

One inspiration for this is the abandoned 12th-century Monastery of Santa Maria de Sei√ßa in Portugal:

<p align="center">
    <img src="Images/Mosteiro-de-Santa-Maria-de-Sei√ßa-1-van-1.jpg" width="300">
    <img src="Images/Mosteiro-de-Santa-Maria-de-Sei√ßa-1-van-1-6.jpg" width="140">

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p align="center">Minecraft (l.), Amnesia - The Dark Descent (m.), The Green Knight (r.)</p>

### Layout

The game will take place entirely indoors. The level design will take inspiration from real-life religious buildings.

<p align="center">
        <img src="Images/abbey_floorplan.png" width="300">
        <p align="center">Kirkstall Abbey floor plan. Source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kirkstall_Abbey_ground_plan.GIF">Wikimedia Commons</a>.
</p>

The world will feature sections ranging from grand halls to claustrophobic corridors.

The game will use procedural generation for both:

- Generating room layouts, and
- Procedural combination of generated rooms

Rooms will be oriented along a shared axis.

### Game World Graphics and Physics

The game world will be rendered in "2.5D" using a pixel art tileset. The tilemap will be overlayed with a static collider for simple player-object and enemy-object collisions.

No elements in the game world will require other physics simulation.

Light and shadow is an important gameplay element in Lantern Head. Lighting will be handled by Unity's 2D Universal Render Pipeline (URP), which enables 2D objects (such as sprites) to interact with light and cast shadows as if they were 3D objects.

Towards the very end of the game, the sun will begin to rise. It is intended that a gradient of light intensity and color will provide a visual guide to the player as to how long the need to survive. A global lighting gradient mockup, with respect to game time, can be seen below.

<p align="center">

    <p align="center">Demonstration of lighting coming through windows across the 5 minutes of game time. Created using Aseprite.

</p>

### Interactivity

- _Environmental lighting_: candles and braziers. Able to be snuffed out by enemies and relit by the player

        <img src="Images/candles_lighting.png" width="100">

<p align="center">

        <img src="Images/health_potion_mockup.png" width="100">

</p>

- _Doors_: manually opened to enter certain rooms
- _Notes_: add flavour

## Art and Audio

<b> Art Style: Pixel Art </b>

Our team loves the pixel art style and thinks that it will be the best fit for our game for the following reasons:

- <b>Unique Aesthetic Appeal</b>: Utilizing pixel art for a horror game adds a distinctive visual charm that stands out in a genre dominated by realistic graphics.
- <b>Engage player's imagination</b>: Pixel art invites players to engage their imaginations, filling in the gaps between pixels with their perceptions of fear. This active participation can intensify the player's overall horror experience.
- <b>Showcase the potential of pixel art style</b>: Pushing the boundaries of pixel art by demonstrating that pixel art can effectively evoke fear, suspense, and mystery.

<b>Color and Atmosphere</b>: The game is going to implement a high contrast between light and shadow with mainly dark blue or green color to build an overall suspenseful and dark atmosphere

| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Avoiding situations where players can win by hiding in a corner for the entire game | Enemies spwan around the main character |
| Design appropriate level difficulty that is challenging but not too difficult | Testing, Evaluation |
| Time constraints (work, other subjects) | Good time management, efficient working, equal distributed tasks |
| Unity, GitHub or Scripting problems | Attend classes, ask questions early enough, own research |
| Merge conflicts | Utilize Communication channel to schedule commits |
